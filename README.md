## Introduction

This repository showcases a series of labs that I have completed as part of my deep learning and CNN studies. The projects demonstrate my understanding of various concepts and my ability to apply them in practical scenarios.

## Laboratories Overview

### LAB01: Introduction to Neural Networks
In this lab, I explored the basics of neural networks, including the perceptron, activation functions, and training methods. The focus was on understanding the foundational concepts that are crucial for building more complex models.

### LAB02: Image Feature Extraction
This lab delves into image processing techniques to extract meaningful features from images. Techniques like edge detection, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), corners detection.

### LAB03: Optical Flow
In LAB03, I implemented optical flow algorithms to estimate the motion of objects in a sequence of images. This is a fundamental technique in video analysis and object tracking. Algorithms explored: Lucas Kanade (sparse and dense implementation).

### LAB04: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
This lab focused on building and training CNNs for image classification tasks. I experimented with different architectures, including Xception network, custom models, and evaluated their performance on various datasets.

### LAB05: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
In LAB05, I explored GANs, a type of deep learning model used to generate realistic images. The lab involved training a GAN to create synthetic images from random noise, highlighting the power of adversarial training. In the second part I explored a DCGAN (Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Networks) and in the last part a comparision between the two models results.

### LAB06: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
This lab involved working with RNNs, particularly for sequence modeling tasks like time series prediction and natural language processing. I implemented models such as LSTM and Transformers to handle sequential data effectively.

### Acknowledgements
I would like to thank the MaLGa Research Center (Machine Learning Genoa Center) at the University of Genoa for providing me with this invaluable opportunity to deepen my understanding of deep learning and convolutional neural networks.
