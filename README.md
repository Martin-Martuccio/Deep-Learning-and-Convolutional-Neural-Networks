## Introduction

This repository showcases a series of labs that I have completed as part of my deep learning and CNN studies. The projects demonstrate my understanding of various concepts and my ability to apply them in practical scenarios.

## Laboratories Overview

### LAB01: Introduction to Neural Networks
In this lab, I explored the basics of neural networks, including the perceptron, activation functions, and training methods. The focus was on understanding the foundational concepts that are crucial for building more complex models.

### LAB02: Image Feature Extraction
This lab delves into image processing techniques to extract meaningful features from images. Techniques like edge detection, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) were implemented.

### LAB03: Optical Flow
In LAB03, I implemented optical flow algorithms to estimate the motion of objects in a sequence of images. This is a fundamental technique in video analysis and object tracking.

### LAB04: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
This lab focused on building and training CNNs for image classification tasks. I experimented with different architectures, including LeNet, AlexNet, and VGG, and evaluated their performance on various datasets.

### LAB05: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
In LAB05, I explored GANs, a type of deep learning model used to generate realistic images. The lab involved training a GAN to create synthetic images from random noise, highlighting the power of adversarial training.

### LAB06: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
This lab involved working with RNNs, particularly for sequence modeling tasks like time series prediction and natural language processing. I implemented models such as LSTM and GRU to handle sequential data effectively.
